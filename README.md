# MATRIX-ELEMENT-REPLACEMENT-QUE-IN-LEETCODE<br>
#EXPLANATION:<BR>
IN THE QUE WE PERFORM TO REPLACE THE ELEMENT 1 WITH 2(TWO) MEAN'S WE PERFORM IN PLACE OF 1 WE PLACED 2 & ANOTHER REMAINING<BR>
ELEMENTS TAKE AS IT IS<BR>
#LOGIC:<BR>
DURING SOLVING THE QUE WE USE THE ARRAY & CONDITION CONCEPT <BR>
STEP 1:GET INPUT DATA FORM THE QUE<BR>
STEP 2:FIRST PRINT THE INPUT MATRIX AS REFERENCE<BR>
STEP 3:USE CONDITION IN THE LOOP FOR EACH ARRAY<BR>
STEP 4:CONDITION:-USE CONDITION FOR EVERY INDICES MEAN CHECK THE ELEMENT IF ELEMENT ARE 1 THEN WE REPLACE WITH 2<BR>
STEP 5:AFTER REPLACEMENT WE PRINT THE MATRIX USING LOOP<BR>
